Introduction
============

This portlet can replace standard Plone navigation portlet but that can also **show contents like a sitemap**.

By default this navigation is displayed as a sitemap with a 2 level sitemap depth.
If you disable the option "display as site map" in portlet edit form, you will retrieve the standard
Plone navigation behavior.
